# higherlower
A higher or lower game based on musical artists and their popularity.

## Description

Our motivation for creting this project was a mutual idea that our group came up with that we thought would be challenging and fun to create. We built this project because we wanted to put the skills that we have learned so far to the test and see how well we could make our idea a reality. This project helped us better impliment the skills that we have learned over the past few weeks and also gain a better understanding on how to use them when writing our code. Creating this project we learned how better team building skills, layout planning and organization and also how to communicate more efficiently with our other group members.

## Usage

To use this Higher||lower game, the users must first click on the "START" button and the game will begin. The users will be taken to the game page where their screen will be split with images of musical artists on both sides of the screen. The users will have the choice of choosing between the two musical artists on who they think would be the more popular of the two. If the users get the choice correct then the game will let the users that they have made the correct choice and the users score will gain "+1" point. If at any point the users make the wrong choice then the game will end and the users will be taken to the "Results" page where they can view their final score and enter their intitials to be placed on the leaderboard. Once the users initials have been entered they will be then taken to the "Leaderboard" page where they can view both their results and the reults of other users that have played the game. Finally users will then have the choice of either ending the game completely or playing again.
