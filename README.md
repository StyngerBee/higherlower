## Description

The motivation behind the project was to test our current knowledge on API’s, and to create a fun, interactive, and unique game with that knowledge. This project helped us better implement the skills that we have learned over the past few weeks and also gain a better understanding on how to use them when programming. Through the creation of this project we also developed better team skills, and learned how to communicate efficiently with our other group members.


## User Story

- Given two songs to compare, with one rank revealed and the other one hidden.
- I want to guess if the hidden rank is higher or lower than the revealed rank.
- Then I press the up-arrow, for higher, and the down-arrow, for lower.
- When correct, I am provided visual feedback,  a popularity widget and the next  comparison.
- When I click the popularity widget, the card flips and the user is given a chart with data regarding the artist’s popularity.
- When incorrect, I am provided visual feedback, a popularity widget and the game ends.
- When the game ends, I am given a score and the option to enter a “username”.
- Then I can save my score to the leaderboard, or play again.
